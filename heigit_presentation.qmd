# Introduction

## Flooding

```{=html}

<iframe width="900" height="600" src="/media/hot_intro.html" title = "Sum Edge Betweenness in the Urban Settlement located in Porto Alegre" data-external="1"></iframe>
```

## Research questions

::: {.incremental}

Analysis based on **graph theory**, where roads are modeled as **vertices** and **edges**. 

1. How does road connectivity change after being impacted by flooding based on connectivity metrics?
2. Which healthcare facilities will be most affected by flooding based on accessibility metrics?
3. Where are the most critical infrastructures located for accessing health facilities to reinforce urban resilience against flooding?

# Methodology

- Data
- Edge Betweenness
- Closeness

## Data

```{=html}

<iframe width="900" height="600" src="/media/osm_ors.html" title = "Origin and destination used and network" data-external="1"></iframe>
```

## Edge Betweenness

:::{.column width="20%"}

Significance of the road counting shortest paths

$$
c_{B}(v) = \sum_{\substack{s \neq t \neq v \\ s,t \in V}} \frac{\sigma(s,t|v)}{\sigma(s,t)}
$$

How central to other vertices is a vertex

$$
\text{CN}(v) = \frac{n - 1}{\sum_{w = 1}^{n - 1} d(w, v)}
$$

## RQ 1: Network centrality
Changes on the centrality before and after the flooding

```

## RQ 1: Network centrality
Distribution of the centrality in the network

## RQ 1: Network centrality
Table with highest connectivity roads

## RQ 2: Hospital centrality - map

## RQ 2: Hospital centrality - ranking

# Conclussion

# Future work{.smaller}
1. Could changes in road centrality be used as an indicator of regional vulnerability in floodings?
2. Could the weighted sampling method based on built-up density be a reliable indicator for modeling people's movement during the flooding event? Would you use other approach to select the points of origin?
3. Would you have considered using other points of interest, such as schools,emergency shelters, bus stops alongside hospitals in the analysis?
4. Do you believe mapping socioeconomic vulnerabilities by neighborhood, alongside these centrality metrics, could help to identify the most important roads in case of flooding?
5. Do you have other ideas for this centrality analysis or other data that could add more value?
